// Blockbeat defines an interface that can be used by subsystems to retrieve
// block data. It is sent by the BlockbeatDispatcher whenever a new block is
// received. Once the subsystem finishes processing the block, it must signal
// it by calling NotifyBlockProcessed.
//
// The blockchain is a state machine - whenever there's a state change, it's
// manifested in a block. The blockbeat is a way to notify subsystems of this
// state change, and to provide them with the data they need to process it. In
// other words, subsystems must react to this state change and should consider
// being driven by the blockbeat in their own state machines.

	// NotifyBlockProcessed signals that the block has been processed. It
	// takes an error resulted from processing the block, and a quit chan
	// of the subsystem.
	//
	// NOTE: This method must be called by the subsystem after it has
	// finished processing the block. Extreme caution must be taken when
	// returning an error as it will shutdown lnd.

// struct cannot pass the interface check for `Consumer` because the `Name`
// method is not implemented, which gives us a "mortise and tenon" structure.

// to work on the concrete type `Beat` to access its internal states.
